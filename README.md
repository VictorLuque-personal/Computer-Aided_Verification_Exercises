# Computer-Aided verification exercises using Dafny and LiquidHaskell

This are some exercises to learn about computer-aided verification using Dafny and LiquidHaskell.

For the Dafny part there are many exercises to learn about the different topics and paradigms the language can verify.

For the LiquidHaskell the exercise is one of the [LiquidHaskell tutorial book](https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-tutorial/book.pdf), concretely two of the chapter 9 about Okasaki's lazy queues.
